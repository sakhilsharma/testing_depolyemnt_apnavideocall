📹 Real-Time Video Calling App
A full-stack real-time video calling application built with modern web technologies, enabling seamless peer-to-peer (P2P) video communication over the internet using WebRTC and WebSockets. Designed with responsiveness, real-time feedback, and user experience in mind.

💡 Think of it as your own secure, scalable video meet platform — built from scratch.

🚀 Features
🔴 Real-time video and audio streaming using WebRTC

📡 Peer-to-peer connection (P2P) for low-latency communication

🌐 Live socket communication using Socket.IO

🖼️ Material UI-based responsive frontend

🔐 Auth-ready backend setup using Express and MongoDB

💻 Optimized for desktop and mobile views

✅ Add authentication (JWT or Firebase)

🎥 Screen sharing


🛠️ Tech Stack
Layer	Technology Used	Why It Matters
Frontend	React, Vite, Material UI	Ultra-fast dev environment, modern UI components
Backend	Node.js, Express, Socket.IO	Scalable server logic, real-time bi-directional communication
Database	MongoDB with Mongoose	NoSQL DB ideal for fast schema updates and horizontal scaling
P2P Engine	WebRTC	Direct media streaming between clients — core of modern video platforms
Realtime	Socket.IO	Event-based communication layer for call negotiation & signaling
Security	bcrypt, crypto	Password hashing, secure token generation

⚙️ Core Concepts Used
Concept	Description
WebRTC (Peer-to-Peer)	Enables direct video/audio/data exchange between clients without routing through a server.
WebSockets with Socket.IO	Real-time signaling between clients for connection setup and negotiation.
Window Object Handling	Accessing camera, microphone, and media devices dynamically using navigator.mediaDevices.
React Component Architecture	Functional hooks-based design for managing state, streams, and UI.


🧠 Why This Stack?
WebRTC & Socket.IO are industry standards for building Zoom-like, WhatsApp Call, or Discord-style real-time apps.

Vite + React 19 provides a lightning-fast developer experience.

Node + Express powers a performant and scalable server backend.

MongoDB lets you scale horizontally and store flexible user/session/call data.
